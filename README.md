5.Digital Divide: Those lacking knowledge of AI may experience a digital divide, creating societal inequalities and hindering people from sharing and benefiting from modern technology opportunities.

In summary, learning and utilizing AI are vital for driving innovation, staying competitive, and addressing challenges in various aspects of our lives. Failure to do so may result in difficulties adapting to the digital age and facing potential risks in terms of employment, information management, and privacy.
